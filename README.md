## Python Coding Requirement
1. Can we download from yahoo finance the full list of stocks by market e.g. Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Japan, China?
2. Can we screen and download from yahoo finance the list of stocks that have closing share price fluctuating within a range of (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 20%, (d) 2% to 20% for the last (i) 5 days, (ii) 10 days, (iii) 20 days, (iv) 50 days by market e.g. Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Japan, China?
3. Can we screen and download from yahoo finance the list of stocks that have 10 days moving average of share price, 20 days moving average of share price, 50 days moving average of share price, 100 days moving average of share price, 150 days moving average of share price, 200 days moving average of share price are within a range of (a) 5%, (b) 10%, (c) 20%, (d) 2% to 20% from each other for the last (i) 5 days, (ii) 10 days, (iii) 20 days, (iv) 50 days by market e.g. Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Japan, China? (note: ie the 10 to 200 days moving average are close to each other)
4. Can we screen and download from yahoo finance the list of stocks that have average closing share price during the last 5 days that is 2% to 20% above the last (i) 5 days, (ii) 10 days, (iii) 20 days, (iv) 50 days, (v) 200 days average closing price by market e.g. Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Japan, China?
5. Can we screen and download from yahoo finance the list of stocks that have average closing share price during the last 5 days that is 2% to 20% below the last (i) 5 days, (ii) 10 days, (iii) 20 days, (iv) 50 days, (v) 200 days average closing price by market e.g. Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Japan, China?
6. Can we screen and download from yahoo finance the list of stocks that have average closing share price range/fluctuation/volatility during the last 10 days (Current Day to Day -9) that is less than the average closing price range/fluctuation/volatility during the earlier 10 days (Day -10 to -19) by market e.g. Singapore, US, Hong Kong, Japan, China? (note: ie the average last 10 days (Current Day to Day -9) price movement is within e.g. 3% compared to the earlier average 10 days (Day -10 to -19) with price movement of e.g. 8%, so the last 10 days average closing price is narrower than the earlier 10 days average closing price)
